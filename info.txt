I am trying to build a Emergency Dashboard, which is going to be used by security guards in a society. Each emergency is a ticket in our system, and we have APIs in place to fetch and get things.
What I require to build is a webapp that is mobile responsive and also for web. I am going to create a react-native mobile app and render this webapp in webview.

I asked someone to reate a design for few things - but I am not happy with the design and responsiveness do not work.
I need your expertiese to sort this.
I want to create few good responsive, uniform-looking webpages in my project for the following things:
- headers and navbar should be uniform in the whole app.
    - there is a chonky implementation for collapsing navbar, if too much trouble I don't mind removing it
    - Navbar should be uniform in all the screens.
    - on mobile it should always be collapsed and there should be a hamburger menu on right side to open/close it

- Login Screen
- Dashboard (main landing page where all the tickets will be seen)
    - Dashboard should have a summary component like it is now that describes emergency metrics: Yet to be attended, Attending, Attended, Today's Total
        - my problem with current implementation is that it is too big and taking alot of space.
        - if we could create it in a small and consice manner, but still show all. It will be good.
    - Filters are very abdrupt and big. I want the filters to be better implemented as per industry standards.
        - datepicker is opening two date-pickers on mobile app
        - on clicking datepicker, it opens and gets closed asap. Not usable on mobile size
    - sidemenu needs to be re-done. It looks very old, I just need to have one good side-menu that is basic and responsive and simple - does the job and works well and looks decent. On both mobile and webapp.
    - Ticket tiles are looking okay, a bit big on mobile app, let me know if there is a scope for improvement.
- emergency/ticket: Looks decent, let me know if any scope of improvement.
- Resident's Directory can be skipped for now.
- Society Info - can be skipped for now

FEEL FREE TO REVAMP THE WHOLE THING AS YOUR LIKINGS, ensuring few things:
- The app should follow same navbar, header uniformity.
- The colour scheme should be followed uniformly.
- headers and navbar should be uniform in the whole app.
- It should be responsive both for mobile and web
- should be aligned to how mondern webapps are created in terms of design and UX
- Feel free to do anything, as long as they cater to current requirement.
- The screens covers right now what we require, but they are not showcasing the same in a better way.
